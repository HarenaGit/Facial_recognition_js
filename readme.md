# Description

This is a test application for a facial recognition in Javascript.

## Note

Launch ``index.html`` directly will not work. You need to run the app in a server so that the tensorflow models are loaded successfully.


## My Configuration

I use VSCode and I install [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension to run the app in order to have my model loaded.
